<h2 align="center">Hi there, nice to meet you!</h2>

I'm a self-taught full-stack developer currently pursuing a career change into software development. Delving deeper and deeper into the world of programming and open source development I've found it aligned with so many of my passions. 

Researching and absorbing new tools and concepts. Problem solving myself through a constantly expanding debugging toolset. Creating maintainable and bulletproof projects through unit testing and integration testing. Collaborating with others and working as part of a team. Teaching others how to problem solve by guiding them to finding the answer on their own. I'm being sincere when I say that software development is amazing, and I'm excited to become a software developer. 

While not creating full-stack Rails projects I volunteer my time helping others learn programming, making open source contributions, and acting as a Moderator for the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

### Outside of Coding...

I'm training for the Chicago Marathon, and plan to run it in October! If I'm not running you can find me spending time with my family, cooking for fun in the kitchen, or slowly making my way through all of the MCU movies.
