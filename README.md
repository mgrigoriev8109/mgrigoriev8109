<h2 align="center">Hi there, I'm Mikhail, nice to meet you!</h2>

I'm a self-taught full-stack developer who is currently looking for work. I'm pursuing a career change into software development because the field allows me to practice so many of the things I love. I love planning, debugging, writing tests, collaborating with others, and teaching others. 

While not creating full-stack Rails projects I volunteer my time helping others learn programming, making open source contributions, and acting as a Moderator for the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

### Outside of Coding...

I spend most of my time with my family, or running (though stroller jogging is a more accurate description). I'm currently training for the Chicago Marathon, and plan to run it in October!
